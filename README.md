 

## About JSON SERVER

JSON Server is a lightweight and easy-to-use Node.js tool that simulates a RESTful API using a JSON file as the data source. With JSON Server, front-end developers can create mock APIs without the need to write complex server-side code, or when a backend API isn't ready yet.

## How to Use JSON Server for Front-end Development
